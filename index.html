                <h2>National Hero Of Pakistan</h2>
                <p>The father of the country is our greatest hero. 
                    <b> Muhammad Ali Jinnah</b> was his name. His efforts resulted in the creation of Pakistan. 
                    He was born on December 25, 1876.Muhammad Ali Jinnah completed his lawyer training in London.
                     He was a member of the Indian National Congress from the beginning. He was a fervent supporter
                      of national politics. He desired to see Hindus and Muslims working together. He conducted numerous 
                      conversations between the two communities for this reason. As a result, he was named the Hindu Muslim
                       Unity Ambassador. With time, he learned that the Hindus desired to rule themselves. <br> As a result, 
                       he resigned from the Indian National Congress. Following that, he began attempting to establish
                        a separateMuslim community. He became a member of the All India Muslim League.His contributions aided in the 
                        formation of the Pakistani concept. The famous Pakistan Resolution was passed on March 23
                        . After the British authorities left, it laid the groundwork for our country. The first Governor-General was
                         Quaid-e-Azam. On September 11, 1948, he died suddenly and was laid to rest in Karachi.
                          We should, like him, continue to work to improve our country. As a result of his contributions,
                           he is regarded as one of Pakistan's greatest heroes.</p>
